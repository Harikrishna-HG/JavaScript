  <h1 style="color:#8000ff;">JavaScript JSON</h1>
  <h2>JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.</h2>
  <p>JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
  </p>
  <h2>JavaScript Object Notation [JSON]</h2>
  <pre>
      {
        "students":[
          {"firstName":"Harikrishna", "lastName":"Gautam"},
          {"firstName":"Sonu", "lastName":"Taylor"},
          {"firstName":"Kamala", "lastName":"Gautam"}
        ]
        }
    </pre>
  <h1 style="color:#8000ff;">JavaScript Hoisting</h1>
  <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.</p>
  <h2>JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted</h2>
  <p>A variable can be used before it has been declared.</p>
  <h2>The let and const Keywords</h2>
  <p>Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.</p>
  <p>Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.</p>

  <h1 style="color:#8000ff;">JavaScript Debugging</h1>
  <p>Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging. </p>
  <p>The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.

  </p>
  <h2>Setting Breakpoints</h2>
  <p>In the debugger window, we can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.

    At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let we examine JavaScript values.

    After examining values, we can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).
  </p>
  <h1 style="color:#8000ff;">JavaScript Operator Precedence</h1>
  <p>Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.</p>
  <p>Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).</p>
