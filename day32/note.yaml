 Java type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

1. AWidening Casting(automatically) - converting a smaller type to larger type size
    byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
2. Narrowing Casting(manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type

    double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

Java Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
 Java divides the operators into the following groups:
 1. Arithmetic operators
 2. Assignment operators
 3. Comparison operators
 4. Logical operators
 5. Bitwise operators


Java Strings are used for storing text
 
Java String Methods:

1.length() method
2.toUpperCase() method
3.toLowerCase()  method

String Concatenation:

The + operator can be used between strings to combine them. This is called concatenation.

Special Characters:

strings must be written within quotes, Java will misunderstand this string, and generate an error.

The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character

\n  --new line
\r  --carriage return
\t  --tab
\b  --backspace
\f  --form feed

Java Math:



1. Math.max(x,y)
2. Math.min(x,y)
3. Math.sqrt(x)
4. Math.abs(x)
5. Math.random();
