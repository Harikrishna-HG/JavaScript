  <h2>JavaScript Let</h2>
  <p>The Let keyword was introduced introduced in ECMAScript(6) 2015</p>
  <p>Variables declared with let have Block Scope</p>
  <p>Variables declared with let must be Declared before use </p>
  <p>Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope</p>
  <h2>ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const</h2>
  <h2>Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.</h2>
  <h1> Let cannot be Redeclared</h1>
  <pre>
    let x = "Harikrishna";
    let x = 0; /* Invalid */
  </pre>
  <h1>Var can be Redeclared</h1>
  <pre>
    let x = "Harikrishna";
    let x = 0; /* valid */
  </pre>
  <h2>Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, is allowed</h2>
  <pre>
    let x = 2;   // Allowed

{
    let x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
    let x = 4;    // Allowed
}
</pre>
<h1>Let Hoisting</h1>
<h2>Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.</h2>

 <h2></h2> Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:
</h2>
  <pre>
    carName = "Tesla";
    var carName; // Allowed
  </pre>
<h2>
  Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
</h2>
<p> Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError</p>
<pre>carName = "Mercedes";
  let carName = "Tesla"; // not allowed</pre>
